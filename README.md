Business Requirements (Why make this app?)
Client needs this app to coordinate communication between drivers and passengers
This app is similar to Uber but different in payment structure. Driver pays a monthly fee instead of a fee for every ride.
This business model is much more attractive than pay-per-match.

User Requirements (Who needs this app?)
People who want to save money need this app. The name of the app is not yet final.

System Requirements (How to make this app?)
We will use FlutterFlow and Firebase to make a mock-up version of the app. In the future we will use Flutter and Firebase for the commercial version of the app.
